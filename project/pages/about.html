    <p>Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy and
        entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. The toy was based on the German Bild Lilli doll
        which Handler had purchased while in Europe.
        <br>
        Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a
        billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and most profitable line.

    <p>Creation: Barbie was invented by Ruth Handler, who co-founded Mattel with her husband, Elliot Handler. She was
        inspired by a German doll named Bild Lilli and wanted to create an adult-bodied doll for children to play with.
        Launch: The first Barbie doll was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York City on March 9,
        1959. This date is considered Barbieâ€™s official birthday.
        Design: The original Barbie was available as a blonde or brunette and wore a black-and-white zebra-striped
        swimsuit. Over the years, her design has evolved, but she has maintained her signature style.</p>
